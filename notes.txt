Presentation Notes:
	1 - generic on-page method
	2 - jquery method
		- always return this
		- you can pass in a collection, so always return this.each()
		- top level "this" is already a jquery object, no need to do $(this)
		- chaining
		- private function
		- closure in setTimeout

	3 - pass in options
		- can over-ride jQuery.fn.reminders.defaults
		- inline v. defaults

	4 - use the $ symbol
		- self-executing function
		- start with semi-colon
		- plays nice with other libraries

	5 - private functions
		- function is namespaced
		- cannot call from outside of plugin
		- can re-factor as plugin evolves without affecting others
		- easier to write tests for

	6 - static functions
		- called on $.reminders, rather than $(element).reminders()

	7 - multiple methods / data
		- $.data() is useful for attaching options and state info to the elements

	8 - events
		- namespacing (click.reminders)

	9 - css
		- add class when method is called
		- give css same name as js
